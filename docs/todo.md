- Vim operators -> "dd" is a good start but we should stop there and move on for now.
- File loading/saving.
- Command mode.
- Multiple buffer support - Buffer management.
- Multiple windows: We're currently using iced's panes to manage that. But there's a couple of adjustments to do in regard to the impl: 
    - No shared buffers currently, we just clone things in new panes.
    - Cursor position is not stored in between panes, so when I focus on another pane, the cursor draws at the beginning of the file.
    - Scrolling feels off, but I assume that does not have to do with panes themselves.
    - Do we care about dragging?
- Status line.
- Line number.
- Syntax Highlighting.
- Split views.
- Multiple cursors - Helix/Zed style.
- LSP.
- Advanced vim features.
- Completion engine.

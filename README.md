# Atlas Text Editor

Atlas is a **fast**, **lightweight** text editor inspired by the philosophy of Emacs, Neovim, and Zed. Its main goal is to be **simple to set up**, **simple to use**, and **optionally modal**â€”allowing you to switch between editing and command modes if you desire, while still being able to operate in a more traditional "insert mode only" style.
